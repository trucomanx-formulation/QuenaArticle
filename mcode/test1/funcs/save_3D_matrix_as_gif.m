function h=save_3D_matrix_as_gif(DATA,Filename,Frames,varargin)
%
%  This function creates a gif file from the data pack (DATA).
%
%  After starting the main routine just type the following command at the
%  prompt:
%  datapack_to_gif(DATA,Filename,Frames);
%  datapack_to_gif(DATA,Filename,Frames,Map);
%  datapack_to_gif(DATA,Filename,Frames,Map,Time);
%  
%  Input:
%  DATA     is the speckle data pack. Where DATA is a 3D matrix created grouping NTIMES 
%           intensity matrices with NLIN lines and NCOL columns. When N=size(DATA), then
%           N(1,1) represents NLIN and
%           N(1,2) represents NCOL and
%           N(1,3) represents NTIMES.
%  Filename is the name of gif file.
%  Frames   is the number of frames in the gif file. In the number of images (NTIMES) 
%           is less than the number of frames (Frames), then overwrite Frames=NTIMES;
%  Map      [Optional] is the colormap, this value can be: jet, gray, hsv, ..., etc.
%           By default: jet. See: colormap('list')
%  Time     [Optional] is the time between frames in the gif file. By default: 0.5 sec.
%
%  Output:
%  h        is the name of gif file.
